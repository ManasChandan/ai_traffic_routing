This project involves building an intelligent, real-time route optimization system for Bangalore using a Streamlit dashboard. The system will recommend the best routes between user-defined pickup and drop-off locations based on multiple factors including real-time traffic conditions, road width, accident data, surveillance camera coverage, and weather forecasts. The project integrates various datasets (road conditions, weather, traffic, etc.) into a spatial grid system using H3 hexagons for efficient geographic indexing and visualization. Machine learning models will be employed to predict traffic congestion based on weather data, time of day, and other variables. The system will display optimal routes, predict travel times, and allow users to navigate and visualize the paths on an interactive map.

The architecture includes microservices created with FastAPI, deployed on Render, for handling various tasks such as real-time traffic prediction, route generation, time estimation, and weather data collection. These microservices will be integrated into the main dashboard, which will be hosted on Streamlit.

Key Features:

 - Real-time route suggestions based on traffic predictions and road conditions.

 - Spatial data indexing and visualization using H3 hexagons and OpenStreetMap.

 - Interactive map interface where users can select pickup and drop-off points.

 - Dynamic traffic congestion predictions using machine learning models.

 - Real-time weather data integration from the OpenWeather API.

 - Travel time estimation based on route characteristics, traffic, and weather conditions.

 - Microservices architecture for scalable and modular functionality.

This project will deliver a fully functional route optimization system that can be easily extended with additional datasets or predictive features in the future.
